## Variants

</summary>

Variants are the individually purchasable part of a product, a Variant may vary on a product based on size or colour for example.
Reference is a field meant for syncing your Variants across services and cannot be updated once created. Changing a Variant's reference is the same as adding a new Variant
Visible manually dictates whether a variant should appear in searches or be purchased.
Variants are ordered by their position. When a position is updated to an already existing position all positions get increased to allow the new position to take that spot.
