# Ecom Portal

In lieu of any ideas of anything to build, I'm just rebuilding an ecom platform I have worked on before but with blackjack and hookers. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Plans:

  - Rails B/E
  - Jsonapi resource api
  - Graphql api (? maybe)
  - Kafka (microservice "synergy")

Features:
  - PIM
  - CSM
  - Carts
  - OMS
  - ...

Admin Panel/Portal:
  - Rails
  - Turbo
  - Tailwind??
  - Mini React apps (complicated forms, promotions flashbacks)

### Booting

#### Production:

N/A

#### Dev: 

```bash
docker-compose up --watch
```

Site available at `localhost:3000`

Command line works as usual:
 
```bash
rails c
rspec
```
